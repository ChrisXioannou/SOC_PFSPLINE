# Network Security Lab with pfSense and Active Directory

## Description
This project simulates a secure, virtualized network environment using **pfSense** for firewall and network security management and **Windows Server 2022** for Active Directory services. The setup includes configuring network adapters for NAT and internal communications, integrating security tools like **Sysmon** and **CrowdSec**, and practicing real-world network administration tasks.

## Environments Used
- **pfSense**: Installed on a Hyper-V virtual machine, configured with NAT and two internal network adapters.
- **Windows Server 2022**: Deployed as a virtual machine, serving as a Domain Controller with Active Directory.
- **Hyper-V**: Used for virtual machine management and network setup.

## Configuration and Tools
### pfSense
- Setup with NAT to manage network traffic and two internal adapters for isolated network segments.
- Configured firewall rules and VPN for secure remote access.

### Windows Server 2022
- Installed and configured Active Directory to manage user accounts and security policies.
- Used Microsoftâ€™s media creation tool to create installation support and ISO.

### Sysmon
- Installed on the Windows Server to enhance Windows event logs with detailed system monitoring data.
- Utilized an XML configuration file for Sysmon, focusing on capturing security-relevant events like process creations and network connections.

### CrowdSec
- Deployed as an additional security layer, utilizing behavior analysis to detect and mitigate threats.
- Integrated with pfSense for real-time security monitoring and response.

## Technical Details and Explanations
### pfSense Configuration
- Set up as the network's primary firewall and gateway, controlling traffic flow and enforcing security policies.
- Utilized for setting up VPNs, managing NAT, and separating network traffic into different security zones (LAN, DMZ).

### Active Directory (AD) on Windows Server 2022
- Configured to manage domain services, user authentication, and authorization within the network.
- Implemented Group Policies to control user and computer configurations.

### Sysmon
- Enhanced the visibility of system activities, crucial for detecting anomalous behavior and security incidents.

### CrowdSec
- Described as a collaborative security tool that uses data from other users to provide automated responses to threats, effectively functioning as a community-driven IDS/IPS system.

## Project Outcomes
This project provided practical experience in network security, system administration, and the use of advanced monitoring tools. It highlighted the implementation of pfSense as a versatile firewall solution, the management of a Windows Server environment with Active Directory, and the integration of security tools like Sysmon and CrowdSec to enhance network defense capabilities.
